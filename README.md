# hffl-salary-table

So far I have html and javascript files for my salary table. I also built a rails API but I'm not sure how to import it or if I need to do that yet.

This project is to render salary tables for the players in my fantasy football league. We should ultimately be able to move or delete players and have the appropriate salary changes be made in conjunction.
